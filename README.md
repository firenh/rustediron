# RustedIron

## by FireNH

A Minecraft Mod built on the Fabric Toolchain for Minecraft 1.18.1 to add in the ability for iron blocks placed in the world to rust. Also adds in new slabs and stair variants for iron! Pretty simple mod overall.

Iron rusts in four stages just like copper, with the stages being known internally as Unaffected (normal), Exposed, Weathered, and Rusted (similar to Oxidized for copper). Axes can scrape layers of rust or wax away, and it can be waxed to prevent further rusting. 

Iron also has new slab and stair variants which can also rust, be waxed, and be scraped by axes.

All iron blocks (waxed and not) can also be converted back into nine iron ingots through crafting.

Requires Fabric API

Thank you to Toilet-Man on GitHub (https://github.com/Toilet-Man) for providing shader support! This change adds appropriate shininess to the rusted iron textures in shaders such as SEUS PTGI.
